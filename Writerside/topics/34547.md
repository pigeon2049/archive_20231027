My top 10 things to watch Friday, Oct. 27 1. Amazon (AMZN) shares jump 7% after the e-commerce giant reported earnings beat Thursday after the bell. Retail strongest ever and changed shopping paradigm. Amazon Web Services cloud unit is taking share and posted gigantic profit. Cost optimization still a headwind but impact is "meaningfully attenuating," advertising growing like mad because of new inferential generative AI — Nvidia (NVDA) — worth billions. Operating income jumped over 340% to $11.12 billion. 2. Intel (INTC) shares rose 7% after chipmaker posted better-than-expected results Thursday. What do you want me to say, PC cycle is back? The company is not as bad as it used to be? Management is endlessly going over what went wrong and is changing? Several price target bumps. HSBC upgrades shares to a hold from sell. 3. Hertz (HTZ) missed on earnings, shows that there is an EV situation that is almost perilous when it comes to both repair costs and depreciation. Ride sharing is best bet. CEO Stephen Scherr says company remains focused on the cost side to improve margins. 4. Not sure what to make of the Ford (F) earnings report. Time to get back to work? Lost a lot of business during the labor strike, more than people realize, and warranty issues continue to hurt the carmaker as well as EV losses. Shares are down more than 3%. 5. The restructuring is starting to work at Club name Stanley Black and Decker (SWK). The tool maker reported an earnings beat and raise this morning before the bell. The stock popped 3.5%. Stay tuned for an alert after management's call with analysts. Looks like it could come back better than Whirlpool (WHR) which reported disappointing results. 6. Bristol Myers (BMY) gets downgraded at William Blair, says new products are not taking shape fast enough. Merck (MRK) remains the power of anti-cancer franchise and still does a good job on Covid, which is meaningful. Shares of the drugmaker up nearly 1% a day after reporting earnings beat. 7. Hasbro (HAS) downgraded to neutral from buy at Bank of America because consumer sales fell 19%. Shares declined more than 1%. Buy Mattel (MAT). 8. Citi opens "positive catalyst watch" on DraftKings (DKNG) into investor day on Nov. 14. Firm says company could raise its long-term adjusted EBITDA target, which is not reflected in shares. 9. Citi and Barclays hammer down their price targets for UPS . This one may be off the rails. 10. Citi cuts price target for Vulcan Materials (VMC) to $229 from $243 on soft outlook. But that's wrong to do. Next year is infrastructure year.
