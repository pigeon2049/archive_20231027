Here's [what we know so far](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/26/1208749860/maine-mass-shooting-lewiston-death-toll) about the suspect, Robert Card.

*   **The incidents led Maine's Democratic congressman Jared Golden** to [change his mind](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1198908910:1208951698) about his long-held opposition to many kinds of gun control, NPR's Brian Mann says on _Up First_.

**Leaders of 27 European nations are calling for a humanitarian pause** to Israel's military response to allow for aid to reach Palestinians trapped in Gaza. Israel has been bombarding the Gaza Strip after Hamas's attacks on Israel on Oct. 7 that killed more than 1,400 people in Israel. The Israeli military said more than 200 people were taken hostage. The Gaza-based Ministry of Health released yesterday a [list of more than 6,700 names](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/27/1208947303/israel-gaza-palestinian-death-toll) — with ages, genders and ID numbers — of people they describe as Palestinians killed in Gaza. The total toll is 7,028 Palestinians, including 2,913 minors, according to the ministry.

*   **NPR's Eleanor Beardsley says** because of their countries' varying histories and populations, it wasn't easy for EU leaders to agree on their humanitarian pause proposal. They all agree that [Israel has a right to defend itself](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1198908910:1208951698) but must follow international law. Beardsley adds the chance of a humanitarian pause is higher now that EU leaders agree with President Biden, who expressed the same support Wednesday.
*   **Israel's intensifying military campaign** has raised fears of a broader regional war with Iran-backed troops. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian tells NPR's Steve Inskeep these groups are [prepared to strike](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/25/1208575570/irans-foreign-minister-armed-groups-are-poised-with-their-finger-on-the-trigger) if the violence continues.
*   **Rami Nashashibi, a Palestinian American community organizer** in Chicago, met with Biden yesterday. He was the [only Palestinian voice](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1208946036:1208946037) in Biden's meeting with Arab and Muslim leaders. He tells NPR's Leila Fadel he wanted the president to understand that "a community as dynamic as ours also deserves that type of basic human empathy."
*   **Biden said Wednesday** that a two-state solution — which calls for an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel — is needed for peace. Here's a look at the proposal's history — and [whether it's still possible](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/27/1208694837/two-state-solution-israeli-palestinian-conflict).

**At least 27 people are dead, and at least four are missing** after Hurricane Otis [unleashed massive flooding](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/26/1208772999/hurricane-otis-acapulco-mexico-deaths) in the Mexican resort city of Acapulco. Otis hit Mexico's southern Pacific coast as a Category 5 hurricane on Wednesday.

*   **From an apartment complex's parking lot** in Acapulco, NPR's Eyder Peralta says the response so far has seemed inadequate. [Aid trucks haven't arrived yet](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1198908910:1208951698), stores are being looted out of desperation, and some people are drinking juice because they've run out of water.

**New York Rep. George Santos is expected to plead not guilty** in a New York court today in a second arraignment for a [growing list of corruption charges](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/27/1208478307/george-santos-charges-theft) from his 2022 election campaign. Yesterday, fellow Republican Rep. Anthony D'Esposito introduced a resolution to expel him from Congress.

**Most Americans feel gun violence is one of the top concerns** in K-12 education, according to an NPR poll. But opinions differ on [how to approach the issue](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/25/1208020283/no-one-wants-kids-dying-in-schools-but-americans-disagree-on-how-to-keep-them-sa) and which safety measures to invest in.

*   **Democrats are more inclined** to support social and emotional safety measures, like guidance counselors and mental health education.
*   **Republicans are more likely** to support expanding security measures like metal detectors and bulletproof glass.
*   **An overwhelming majority** of Americans want active shooter drills. But support drops if the drills are graphically realistic.
