[Instagram is testing](https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/Cy6c28fPlzc/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D) a new feature that will let your friends add to your posts. When you’re about to post a carousel, Instagram will give you the option to let followers submit their own photos and videos that they want to include.

The submissions won’t get added to your post by default, as you’ll have to approve each photo and video before they’re added. In a screenshot of the feature shared by Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri, collaborative carousels will have an “add to post” button in the bottom-left corner.

This feature seems like a nice way to invite friends to share memories of recent outings or events you attended together. There are probably a lot of other creative prompts people can come up with, too, like having your friends and followers submit their favorite pet pictures.

Instagram already lets you [collaborate with other creators](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734118/instagram-collabs-desktop-posts-superbeat-dynamic-3d-lyrics-product-week) on the platform to create shared feed posts or Reels. The platform also recently rolled out a [collaborative collections feature](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/29/23662175/instagram-collaborative-collections-shared-with-friends), which lets you share and save images with up to 250 people.
