Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ are popular distributed messaging systems with functionalities for real-time data processing, analytics, event-driven architectures, and more. Kafka is a distributed streaming platform with high throughput, low latency, and a publish-subscribe model. RabbitMQ is a message broker with support for multiple protocols and flexible routing capabilities. Kafka excels in real-time data processing, event sourcing, and log aggregation, while RabbitMQ is suitable for asynchronous communication, microservices communication, and IoT data ingestion.
