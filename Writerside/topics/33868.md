Abstract:

Amazon is set to officially launch the .BOT domain suffix on October 30, 2023 (this Monday). The .BOT domain is a unique top-level domain (TLD) provided by Amazon, specifically designed to cater to the field of artificial intelligence (AI)

According to foreign media reports, Amazon is set to officially introduce the .BOT domain suffix on October 30, 2023 (this Monday). This domain suffix is specifically designed to serve the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. Pre-registration is currently available on the EnCirca platform.

The .BOT domain is a unique top-level domain (TLD) provided by Amazon, aimed at catering to the artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics field. This domain extension differs from traditional TLDs such as .COM, .NET, or .ORG because it is exclusively focused on AI and robot applications.

In recent years, Amazon has restricted access to .BOT domains, exclusively offering them to registrants directly involved with AI robots. Once .BOT domains enter general availability on Monday, all registration restrictions will be lifted.

.BOT Domain Pre-registration Fees

Registration: $68.98 (approximately 504 RMB)

Renewal: $75 (approximately 548 RMB)

Transfer: $75 (approximately 548 RMB)

Some domains may be premium or blocked.

General availability for .BOT domains begins on October 30, 2023.

Please note that pre-registration does not guarantee successful registration. If we are unable to secure the domain for you, your fee will be refunded.

Amazon's official launch of the .BOT domain is intended to encourage innovation and promote growth in the AI and robotics field. This domain extension aims to be a unified, AI- and robotics-focused internet space, providing better visibility and discovery opportunities for professionals in this field. By using .BOT domains, websites and applications related to the AI and robotics industry can be more easily found and identified, contributing to the development and expansion of this sector.

With Amazon's recent introduction of the .BOT suffix, do you think it will have an impact on .AI domains?
