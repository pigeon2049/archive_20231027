Qatar told the United States that it was open to reconsidering Hamas's presence on its territory, a senior U.S. official said on Friday, once the crisis over scores of hostages kidnapped by the Islamist militant group is resolved.

The understanding, which was first reported by the Washington Post, was reached during a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, when the top U.S. diplomat was visiting Doha earlier this month, the official said.
