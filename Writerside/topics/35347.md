Disney’s delaying its upcoming [live-action _Snow White_ remake starring Rachel Zegler](https://www.vulture.com/2021/06/west-side-story-star-rachel-zegler-to-star-in-snow-white.html), but the studio’s also just released a new photo of the film’s take on the seven dwarfs that’s rather… let’s say “interesting.”

[According to _The Hollywood Reporter_](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/disney-delays-snow-white-actor-strike-1235629856/), Disney has decided to push back the release dates for director Marc Webb’s _Snow White_ and Pixar’s new feature [_Elio,_ from director Adrian Molina](https://www.theverge.com/23759508/pixar-elio-teaser-trailer). The delay is in response to SAG-AFTRA’s ongoing labor strike, which reportedly has [multiple studios considering the possibility](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/imax-ceo-actors-strike-will-lead-to-some-movement-in-2024-release-dates-202208730.html) of having to rearrange their 2024 release schedules to make up for the lack of new work. Though _Snow White_ was originally meant to debut on March 22nd, 2024, it’s been pushed back to March 21st, 2025, and _Elio_, which was scheduled to hit theaters on March 1st, 2024, will now release more than a year later on June 13th, 2025.

In a seeming attempt to get ahead of the delay news, Disney also [shared a new image](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/snow-white-disney/) of Zegler in costume as Snow White alongside the classic fairy tale’s dwarfs, and while the lead actor looks more or less as expected, her companions all appear to be varying degrees of, well, _alarming_ the longer you stare at them.

This new official image comes months after [set photos from the film’s production](https://www.avclub.com/snow-white-rachel-zegler-fake-set-photos-1850642707) prompted conservative critics to accuse Disney of “going woke” by portraying the seven dwarfs as a racially and physically diverse group of people, as opposed to [a septet of offensive caricatures of people with dwarfism](https://www.polygon.com/22900624/peter-dinklage-disney-snow-white-movie-remake-dwarfism). At the time, Disney [emphasized to _Vanity Fair_](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/07/those-politically-correct-snow-white-set-photos-are-fake-says-disney) that while those early photos were from _Snow White_’s set, they were not official and depicted “stand-ins” for some cast members.

Obviously, set photos aren’t always indicative of how a movie’s ultimately going to turn out, and Disney’s new image does seem to indicate that the live-action _Snow White_ is going to take notes from the 1937 film. But given the approach Disney’s taken to updating its other recent big-screen remakes, it wouldn’t be at all surprising if both photos show us exactly what the new _Snow White_’s dwarfs are going to look like given how tricksy curses are sort of a big deal in the story that made them famous.
