Market Movers rounded up the latest reactions to Amazon from investors and analysts. Jim Cramer dissected the tech giant's third-quarter results, which were issued late Thursday. Amazon took on cost-cutting measures in 2023, which included laying off thousands of employees. The e-commerce giant also saw its revenue jump 13% from this period last year. The company is also expecting fourth-quarter sales to be between $160 billion and $167 billion. Amazon closed the trading session up 6.8% and is currently held in Cramer's Charitable Trust portfolio.
