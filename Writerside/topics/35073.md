It’s not often we see good deals land on new Sonos products, so the [company’s early Black Friday sale](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/promotional-offers) is one to take a look at. Now through Sunday, October 29th, Sonos is taking up to 20 percent off various home theater sets, offering you a chance to save up to $385 on some of the [best soundbars](https://www.theverge.com/22950789/best-soundbar) in the market.

First up, Sonos is offering some great bundle deals that include Sonos’ flagship soundbar, the [**Sonos Arc**](https://www.theverge.com/21279703/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-price-specs-features). You can buy it bundled with the **third-gen Sonos Sub,** a subwoofer that handles the low end, [for $1,358 ($340 off)](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/entertainment-set-arc-sub). You can also throw in **two** [**Sonos Era 300**](https://www.theverge.com/23657335/sonos-era-300-review-spatial-audio-atmos-speaker) **smart speakers or** [**Sonos Era 100**](https://www.theverge.com/23656561/sonos-era-100-speaker-review-features) **smart speakers** for use as rear surrounds for [$2,211 ($385 off)](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/ultimate-immersive-set-arc-sub-era-300-pair) and [$1,856 ($340 off)](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/premium-immersive-set-arc-sub-era-100-pair), respectively.

In case you need a refresher, the Sonos Arc is an all-in-one home theater soundbar that’ll amp up the audio on your TV with powerful and immersive sound. It works particularly well with large 4K TVs that support Dolby Atmos and also feature eARC support. The Arc additionally supports Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Apple’s AirPlay 2 and can work as a standalone smart speaker for playing tunes.

Meanwhile, the Sonos Era 300 and 100 are Wi-Fi-connected bookshelf speakers released earlier this year. Both support Bluetooth audio and line-in playback via an optional 3.5mm to USB-C adapter, but only the Sonos Era 300 supports Dolby Atmos and plays spatial tracks from Apple Music and Amazon Music.

The Sonos Arc is a powerful Dolby Atmos speaker that also integrates with the company’s multiroom audio platform. With extra capabilities like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple’s AirPlay 2, it’s a feature-rich soundbar that sounds just as good when playing music.

Alternatively, you can buy the midrange [**second-generation Sonos Beam**](https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs) bundled with the **Sub Mini subwoofer** for [$742 ($186 off)](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/entertainment-set-beam-sub-mini). Adding in **two Sonos Era 100 smart speakers**, meanwhile, brings that price up to [$1,240 ($186 off)](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/immersive-set-beam-sub-mini-era-100-pair). The Sonos Beam also supports Dolby Atmos and eARC, while doubling as a smart speaker that works with Apple’s AirPlay 2, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant. However, the Beam is smaller than the Sonos Arc and lacks its upward-firing Dolby Atmos speakers, so its sound quality isn’t quite as impressive as the Arc’s.

The Sonos Beam (second-gen) is a compact soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos and can stream music from a plethora of services.

Finally, if both the Sonos Beam and Arc are out of your budget, the entry-level [**Sonos Ray**](https://www.theverge.com/23149484/sonos-ray-soundbar-review) soundbar is also on sale. It doesn’t have Dolby Atmos support, so it lacks the same immersive sound quality, and it doesn’t have HDMI connectivity, either. Nevertheless, it offers good value for your money, outperforming other soundbars in this price range with its crisp, balanced sound and voice clarity. It also comes with support for Apple AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect. You can buy the **Sonos Ray bundled with the Sub Mini subwoofer** for [$566 ($142 off) from Sonos](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/entertainment-set-ray-sub-mini).

The Sonos Ray is the latest entry-level soundbar from Sonos that’s designed to be a budget-friendly version of the Arc and Beam. It sounds impressive for its small size, though it lacks support for Dolby Atmos surround sound and HDMI connectivity like the Arc and Beam.
