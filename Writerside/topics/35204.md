The Onewheel GT S-Series is the priciest yet.

One month after Onewheel [recalled every single one of its electric skateboards after four known deaths and a year of delay](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/29/23896151/onewheel-cpsc-recall-future-motion-crash-death), the company’s releasing its fastest, most powerful, and most expensive board yet.

It’s called the [Onewheel GT S-Series](https://onewheel.com/pages/onewheel-gt-s-series), and the $3,200 board will already come with the new safety mechanism it told the government it’d add to several previous generations of Onewheel — [called Haptic Buzz](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/29/23896151/onewheel-cpsc-recall-future-motion-crash-death#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHaptic%20Buzz%E2%80%9D%20feedback), it vibrates the board when it’s running out of battery, attempting to exert too much torque, or is erroring out.

Speaking of torque, the S-Series adds more of it — the primary upgrade here is a new motor with 50 percent more voltage and 50 percent more torque. The company promises “high-speed carves up even the steepest of hills,” though it doesn’t specify any particular degree of incline or grade.

It does share that the S-Series has a top speed of 25 miles per hour (up from 20mph) at 113 volts (up from 75v), at a shorter range of 16-25 miles (down from 20-32 mi) on its half-inch wider tires. At 33 pounds, it also weighs two pounds less.

Onewheel also says it’s got a lowered ride height, but the board’s dimensions are identical, and it hasn’t changed the position of the wheel — instead, you’ll stand just five millimeters shorter on the board because it has slightly more concave footpads.

[Here’s the company’s compare page](https://onewheel.com/pages/compare).

Is a more desirable board enough for you to forgive the company for gaslighting the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, pretending its boards didn’t have issues for nearly a year, and [telling you to trash its earliest products](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/29/23896151/onewheel-cpsc-recall-future-motion-crash-death#:~:text=new%20video.-,For%20early%20adopters,-%2C%20however%2C%20owners%20can) that can’t be updated for a measly $100 in store credit? Genuine question.

If yes, please wear a helmet — and not just a bike helmet, something that’ll protect your chin. I wore a bike helmet when I broke my jaw in an electric scooter accident, and I wasn’t going nearly as fast as this Onewheel now can.
