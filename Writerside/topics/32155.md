**Former Chinese premier Li Keqiang has died at 68, state media has reported.**

He was the second most powerful man in the ruling Chinese Communist Party until he retired last year.

State media said had been "resting" in Shanghai when he suffered a sudden heart attack on Thursday.

He passed away ten minutes past midnight on Friday despite "all-out efforts" to revive him, state broadcaster CCTV said.

Li rose through the party ranks despite not having any power base, and at one point was even pegged for the top role of president.

In his final term, he became the only incumbent top official who didn't belong to Chinese President Xi Jinping's loyalists group.

The elite Peking University-educated leader was known for being pragmatic in economic policies.

He developed a reputation as a leader who works for the less privileged, with policies that focus on reducing the wealth gap and providing affordable housing.

A trained economist, he was initially given the reins of China's economy, but in recent years was sidelined in that role.
