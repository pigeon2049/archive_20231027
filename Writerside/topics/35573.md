The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued a warning to consumers to not purchase or use certain eye drops from several major brands due to the risk of eye infection. The agency warned against the use of 26 over-the-counter eye drop products and said using them could result in partial vision loss or blindness. The eye drops are marketed by CVS Health (CVS.N), Rite Aid (RADCQ.PK) Cardinal Health (CAH.N) along with Target's (TGT.N) up & up brand and Velocity Pharma, the FDA said in a statement. It has also asked the manufacturer to recall all lots of the product. - Reuters
