Israeli bombing of Gaza has killed 50 of the hostages seized during raids by Palestinian militants on Oct. 7, Russia's Kommersant newspaper quoted a member of a Hamas delegation visiting Moscow as saying.

It quoted Abu Hamid as saying Hamas could not release the hostages until a ceasefire was agreed, and it needed time to locate all of those who had been taken to Gaza by various Palestinian factions.
