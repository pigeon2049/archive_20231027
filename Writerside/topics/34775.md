Panama has been removed from the gray list of financial crime watchdog FATF, a register which includes countries deemed to be doing too little to combat money laundering, according to a government statement on Friday.

Panama's first stint on the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) so-called gray list, which can impact a country's investment ratings and reputation, was from 2014 to 2016.

It was added back again in 2019.

Panama's Deputy Financial Minister Jorge Almengor had told Reuters in June [he expected Panama to be excluded](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/panama-expects-be-struck-off-financial-crime-watch-list-october-2023-06-29/) from the list this month, after authorities had addressed watchdog requests to boost financial transparency.

Almengor had said this was an urgent issue so Panama could reclaim its place as a financial hub.

Panama's President Laurentino Cortizo celebrated the decision on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.
